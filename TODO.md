* I need to show off more SaltStack skills. Find a meaningful application to use Salt. And do it.
* Repo clean-up. There are some unneeded files.
* Use test_db as a submodule.
* Extend this demo beyond Ubuntu. It is pretty easy. Templating the update process and service management (systemd). Can assume all systems we support use systemd. Probably I don't need initial update, bootstraps do that anyway.
* Think about Nix.
